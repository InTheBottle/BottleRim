## BottleRim Et' Ada 1.4.0 - Not Save Safe

## Not Save Safe
## Summary
- For honor in skyrim, using the lorerim patch fits the list pretty well and the for honor movesets will be one of four stances you can use in third person combat
- Swapped mundus for curse of the firmament, standing stones have a cost now instead of a flat buff. 
- Gods and Worship was swapped in place of Pilgrim, Pilgrim i respect the simplicity, but I want Stendar to ruin my life if he catches me raising the dead
- Sacrosanct in place of Scion, Enai beast mods are just more fun
- Growl in place of manbeast, see above reasoning
- New textures for farmhouses, nordic ruins and more
- More mesh fixes, better ordered list
- More bug fixes I was missing on Nexus
- Of course more patching
- Adamant addons, I'll let you guys check those out in game they're pretty cool
- Some new Kittytail magic
- All of kittytails FX improvements
- Nexus CS should look a little better (black magic)
- Swapped true light, WSU ALTM and XEMI util for Lux.cs. Looks better imo and as annoying as all the extra ESPs are, generally it works better too.
- Another small one but cool, vanilla music will now play in addition to the replacer. (it was supposed to before i just didn't read the requirements)
- A few new quests

## BottleRim Et' Ada 1.4.1 - Save Safe

## Save Safe
- Fixed followers only working on reload
- Fixed mercenary fee dialogue
- Cleaned up spell menu clutter
- Fixed stances finally
With "fixing" stances, comes a handful of new NPC combat anims

## BottleRim Et' Ada 1.5.0 - Not Save Safe
- As far as I can tell, the shadow scene node crashes are gone, I've been playing in problem areas and have had no issues as there were in prior versions
- Major mesh cleanup to resolve errors and CTDs
- XPMSSE redo, no more CBPC (I didn't know IED handled weapon physics :sobbign: )
- NORTHERN ROADS. I painted and fixed as much as i could find landscape texture seam wise. Please spam report them when you find them. They are easy to fix and I can do it in a save safe way.
- Nordic Dungeons look way cooler
- Timed block, this can be made to be more difficult or easier depending on what you want. It negates damage when done properly. Combat was hard enough, this makes it flow a bit better and actually gives you a tiny chance in the early levels.
- Dawnguard Arsenal, Reforging to the Masses, and Lore weapon expansion have been added and integrated into the leveled lists using skypatcher.
- More clothing variants for NPCs
- More armor for NPCs
- Properly distributed CC Alternate Armors
- Touched up the leveled list patch for the list
- Riften has been completely overhauled, its sick go look.
- EFPs has been added, I ran around everywhere at mach speed testing this and did not find any occlusion issues, if you do just report and i can fix pretty easily.
- Grass cache (finally) grass distance has been extended to a more reasonable and better looking setting.
- Fixed all issues reported in #🔧bottlerim-support if I missed one that you notice please just ping me I don't mind.
- Val Serano has been added
- Alternate armors CC quests have been changed to be more immersive and just make more sense.
- Eyes are way cooler and more in depth, tons of customization options take your time in Racemenu and check them out.
- New camping system
- Alternate death mod
